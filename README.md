# Movie_App
This is a Movie search app created using ReactJS (functional components) + OMDB API + Bootstrap, you can search any movie, add it to favorites list also remove from it.

PS: The original app has the capability of storing your favourite movies into localstorage(even if you refresh the page the favourites will be saved). Due to live hosting I have commented those lines in the App.js file, if you want that feature to enabled you can always Toggle comment and check that out locally.

This "Movie App" is live hosted via : https://movie-app-reactjs.netlify.app
